# Ruby Bootcamp

Welcome to the Ruby Bootcamp!

Start with the [Course Dashboard](http://prezi.com/adnfktg98mli/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share). This is an interactive presentation that contains the material you will be learning, the exercises to help cement that learning and the suggested flow to go through.

Work through this presentation methodically and when you get to the end you're done :)

## Notes

- This course is still be actively developed so if something is not clear please check in with your trainers to find out what's next.
- This course assumes that you don't know Ruby but have are exerienced in another object oriented programming language, know TDD and at least one testing framework. Missing one of these things? Although it's not the core remit of the course to teach OO or TDD you will be doing lots of it and will have real opportunity to get stuck even more new things.
